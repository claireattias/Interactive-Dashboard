This activity builds an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

- Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 microbial species (OTUs) found in that individual

- Created a bubble chart that displays each sample 

- Displayed the sample metadata

- Created a gauge chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual
 
Plots update when a new sample is selected
